/* Recommended /proc/sys/net/unix/max_dgram_qlen for unix:// outputs.
 *
 * AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM blocks on the *receiver's* queue depth, which the
 * kernel snapshots from this sysctl when the receiving socket is created.
 * The kernel default of 10 datagrams is roughly 7 ms of buffer at 15 Mbps
 * with 1400-byte RTP payloads — less than one frame at 60 fps, so every
 * frame overruns it and the encode thread stalls waiting on consumer
 * scheduling.  256 gives ~180 ms at 15 Mbps, which absorbs ordinary
 * scheduling jitter without the send path ever blocking.
 *
 * The producer cannot fix this for a consumer that is already running --
 * raising the sysctl only affects sockets created afterwards.  It has to
 * be raised at boot (see init.d/S95waybeam); we only warn. */

/* Send-queue accounting for one udp:// / unix:// socket.
 *
 * `sndbuf_capacity` is the kernel-reported SO_SNDBUF captured once at
 * socket open.  `unix_capacity` is the observed unix:// saturation point
 * in SIOCOUTQ bytes, learned the first time a send blocks or fails with
 * EAGAIN; 0 until that happens.  See output_socket_note_saturation().
 * `logged_capacity` keeps the one-shot calibration log to one line per
 * socket.
 *
 * THREADING: every field is touched by more than one thread, so all three
 * are accessed with relaxed atomics.
 *
 *   - producer (encode) thread: output_socket_note_saturation() raises
 *     `unix_capacity` and sets `logged_capacity` on the send/flush path.
 *   - HTTP/status thread: output_socket_get_fill_pct() reads both capacities
 *     to scale the reported percentage.
 *   - control thread: output_socket_capture_capacity() RESETS all three on a
 *     live transport redirect (star6e_output_apply_server /
 *     maruko_output_apply_server).
 *
 * That last one makes this multi-writer, not single-writer.  The
 * `transport_gen` seqlock does NOT serialise it: the producer reads the
 * seqlock only to snapshot the transport into its batch, then flushes
 * outside it, so a redirect can land while a flush is still calling
 * note_saturation() on this struct.
 *
 * Relaxed is the right strength: each field is an independent scalar used
 * only to scale a telemetry percentage, and nothing else is published
 * through them, so no ordering with other stores is implied or needed.
 *
 * The atomics remove the undefined behaviour, not the interleaving.  A
 * redirect racing an in-flight flush can still leave `unix_capacity` holding
 * the previous socket's learned value, because note_saturation()'s
 * compare-then-store is not itself atomic.  That is bounded and
 * self-healing: the next saturation on the new socket recalibrates it, and
 * the only consequence meanwhile is a skewed fill percentage.  Serialising
 * it properly would need a lock on the encode thread's send path, which
 * costs more than the telemetry is worth.  Without the atomics this was also
 * a plain data race the compiler could exploit — one no test can catch,
 * since the host suite never runs these threads against this path
 * concurrently. */
